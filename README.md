Welcome to the repository for the developer tasks of the Future Learn **open-source course** [Become a Blockchain Developer: Foundations Edition](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/become-a-blockchain-developer-foundations) ðŸŽ“.

This course aims at providing a reliable basis for developers to get started in the blockchain and distributed ledger technology domain.

This course is divided into **articles** and **developer exercises**, where the articles explain the theoretical foundations behind what is applied in the exercises. To access the articles you will need to sign up on [Future Learn](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/become-a-blockchain-developer-foundations)  


## Course Outcomes

At the end of this course you will have gained both theoretical and practical knowledge about distributed ledger technologies, specifically:

### Theoretical Outcomes
Reading and understanding the course articles will provide you with knowledge to understand the key foundational aspects of blockchains and other distributed ledger technologies. In summary you will have learned:

- What defines a ledger
- What components make up distributed ledger technologies
- What exactly is a blockchain
- How distributed ledgers can be organised in a Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) or Accounts based method
- What cryptography underpins distributed ledger technologies

### Practical Outcomes
Completing the course exercises will provide you with the foundational practical experience to start creating multi-ledger decentralised applications (mDapps). In summary you have learned:

- How to interact with multiple distributed ledger technologies (specifically Bitcoin, Ethereum and the XRP Ledger)
- How to connect to multiple distributed ledger technology networks (specifically the test networks of the previously listed technologies)
- How to read blocks, transactions and state information from these DLT networks
- How to add new transactions to these DLT networks

Future courses will expand on these features to show how more complicated mDapps can be built.
